# carRepairShop

This program creates an optimized repair schedule, scheduling in each customer 
in the shortest possible time frame, given 4 repair “rooms” and the following user inputs:
     1)	Services offered by the repair shop and its service duration
     2)	Available mechanics and their services offered, and hours they can work per day
     3)	Customers and the service needed to be repaired (somehow cut project shorter)
